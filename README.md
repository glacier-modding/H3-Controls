# H3-Scaleform-Decompilation-Project

## Known Issues
* Fonts look weird in some places.
* Font colour is not correct for distance text in-game and probably other things as well.
* Some buttons in the main menu like the "Go Online" and "Patch Notes" have a broken icon.
* Game version text is too small.

## Todo
* Organise all the symbols in the fla files.
    * Moving shared ones to libraries like what was done with ButtonPrompt.fla.
    * Create folders.
    * Rename symbols that don't have proper names? (Not sure if this will make it harder to update the files when new game versions come out.)
* Figure out more variable names for scripts.
* Fix bugs, bugs, bugs and more bugs.
* Don't go insane.
