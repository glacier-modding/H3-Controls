# H3-Scaleform-Decompilation-Project

## Known Issues
* Some classes in common.fla are broken and end up breaking UI elements. I'm suspecting something related to the BaseControl or MenuElement ones.
* Button prompts are broken (Adobe Animate has warnings about these).
* Probably 100+ other bugs that I haven't found yet.
