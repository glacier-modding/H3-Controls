# H3-Scaleform-Decompilation-Project

## Known Issues
* Some classes in common.fla are broken and end up breaking UI elements. I'm suspecting something related to the BaseControl or MenuElement ones.
* Button prompts are broken (Adobe Animate has warnings about these).
* Probably 100+ other bugs that I haven't found yet.

## Todo
* Organise all the symbols in the fla files.
    * Moving shared ones to libraries like what was done with ButtonPrompt.fla.
    * Create folders.
    * Rename symbols that don't have proper names? (Not sure if this will make it harder to update the files when new game versions come out.)
* Figure out more variable names for scripts.
* Fix bugs, bugs, bugs and more bugs.
* Don't go insane.
